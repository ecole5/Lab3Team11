You need to kill the apache2 service running on the host.
sudo service apache2 stop -- i have permently disabled at startup
You need to detach from a1 using escape seqence ctrl p and ctrl q as it is in tty mode 
We build with .
docker stats -a (this will show live containers total memory) 
We use compose v2.2 because it supports cpu limits without swarm
